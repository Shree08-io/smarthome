Sending sensor values to server and AWS via MQTT and AWS-MQTT and controlling lights using Alexa application


Moving beyond just connected infrastructure and smarter things, the smart cities of tomorrow engage, governments, citizens, visitors, and businesses in an intelligent, connected ecosystem. The goal: better city services and a higher quality of life. Hence, SMART CITY is an area that uses different types of electronic sensors to collect data and then use insights gained from that data to manage assets, resources and services efficiently.

Smart Cities can share a common smart city platform, which makes sense especially for small cities. The cloud-based nature of IoT solutions for smart cities can from a common urban ecosystem. In this way, solutions of small and large smart cities are networked and controlled via the central cloud platform.

1.	HOME AUTOMATION: The IoT based Home Automation will enable the user to use a Home Automation System based on Internet of Things (IoT). The modern homes are automated through the internet and the home appliances are controlled from anywhere


2.	ROAD MANAGEMENT: In Road Management we are controlling following services:-
    a.	SMART STREET LIGHT : The aim of automated streetlight management system using IOT is the conservation of energy by reducing               electricity wastage as well as to reduce the manpower. Streetlights are the elemental part of any city since it facilitates better         night visions, secure roads, and exposure to public areas but it consumes a quite large proportion of electricity.
    b.	TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT : By using IoT traffic management issue can be solved. Thus it can be easy to find the path for emergency                condition in ambulance. The traffic violators are captured and thus can be send to the Police. 
    c.	WASTE MANAGEMENT : The most common IoT use case in waste management is route optimization, which reduces fuel consumption while           emptying the dumpsters throughout the city. Gateways play the role of bridging the gap between the IoT platform and sensor,               sending data from the sensor to the cloud.

3.	SMART ELECTRICITY: IoT based energy meter is based on Arduino. The system eliminates the human involvement in electricity maintenance.The theft of electricity increases the costs paid by consumers. Hence this system is used for theft detection.

4.	WATER MANAGEMENT: Water conservation is one of the essential aspects in water management, specifically in urban areas, where keeping a record of water consumption is extremely challenging. Water management using IoT devices is to manage and monitor the level of water as well as the PH quality of water.

5.	SMART PARKING: The proposed Smart Parking system consists of an on-site deployment of an IoT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space. Thus it can be efficiently used for parking management in urban areas where the issue of parking is big deal.
